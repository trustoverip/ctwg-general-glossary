~ In our digital mental model it's an _official_ digital _record book_. When people refer to a registry, they usually mean a specific instance, within a multi-tenant registry. E.g. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a multi-tenant registry, where there’s a set of [official / public images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/).
