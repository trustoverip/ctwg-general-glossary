[[def: internal-inconsistency, internal inconsistency]]

~ Internal is used to describe things that exist or happen inside an [[ref: entity]]. In our scope of digital [[ref: identifier]] its (in)consistency is considered within the defining data structures and related data stores.

~ In [[ref: key-event-receipt-infrastructure]], you are protected against internal inconsistency by the hash chain data structure of the [[ref: key-event-log]] because the only [[ref: authority]] that can sign the log is the [[ref: controller]] itself.
