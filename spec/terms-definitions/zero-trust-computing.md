[[def: zero-trust-computing, zero-trust computing]]

~ A security model centered on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats can exist inside and outside the network, and thus, no entity — a device, user, or system — is inherently trusted. This approach requires continuous verification of all users and devices attempting to access network resources.
