[[def: side-channel-attack, side-channel attack]]

~ any attack that extracts secrets by observing indirect information leaked by a system — things like how long it takes to do an operation, how much power it uses, emitted radio/EM noise, cache behavior, or even tiny sounds — rather than breaking the cryptography or protocol directly.
