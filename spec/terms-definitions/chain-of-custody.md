[[def: chain-of-custody, chain of custody]]

~ From Wikipedia ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody)):
~ Chain of custody (CoC), in legal contexts, is the chronological documentation or [paper trail](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paper_trail) that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of materials, including physical or electronic [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence). Of particular importance in criminal cases, the concept is also applied in civil litigation and more broadly in drug testing of athletes and in [supply chain management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management), e.g. to improve the [traceability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceability) of food products, or to provide assurances that wood products originate from [sustainably managed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_forest_management).
