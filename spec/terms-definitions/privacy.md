[[def: privacy, privacy]]

~ Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

~ The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security), which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [bodily integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity).
