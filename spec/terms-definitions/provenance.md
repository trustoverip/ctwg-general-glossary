~ From Wikipedia ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance)):

~ Provenance (from the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) provenir, 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object. The term was originally mostly used in relation to [works of art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_of_art) but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology), [paleontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology), [archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive), [manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript), printed books, the [circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy), and science and computing.
