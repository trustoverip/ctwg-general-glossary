[[def: concise-binary-object-representation]]

~ It is a binary data [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) format loosely based on [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) authored by C. Bormann. Like JSON it allows the transmission of data objects that contain [nameâ€“value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair), but in a more concise manner. This increases processing and transfer speeds at the cost of [human readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable_medium).
