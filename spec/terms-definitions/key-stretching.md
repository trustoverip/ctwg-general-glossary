[[def: key-stretching, key stretching]]

~ In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), key stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)), typically a [password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password) or [passphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase), more secure against a [brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key.
