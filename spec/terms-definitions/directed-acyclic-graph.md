[[def: directed-acyclic-graph, directed acyclic graph]]

~ From Wikipedia ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)):

~ In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), particularly [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a directed acyclic graph (DAG [/ˈdæɡ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) ([listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/En-us-DAG.ogg))) is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) with no [directed cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph#Directed_cycle_graph). That is, it consists of [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)) and [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory)) (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another.
